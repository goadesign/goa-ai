# Welcome to Your Goa-AI Agents! 👋

This guide is your personal co-pilot, generated specifically to help you bring your new AI agents to life. We'll go from the code Goa just created to a running agent in a few simple steps.

> **A Quick Note on This File:**
>
> - **Want to hide me?** No problem! Add `DisableAgentDocs()` to your `API` design and I won't be generated next time.
> - **Safety First:** It's safe to delete this file. It will reappear, updated, after the next `goa gen`.
> - **Golden Rule:** Never edit the `gen/` directory directly. Your design files are the source of truth!
